# Data Science Cookie Cutter Project Template Generator
A cookie cutter project template generator is a tool which generates a project file and directory structure template so that you don't have to do this from scratch every time. They are great time savers, and also help remind you to create all the little bits, such as README.md's and LICENSE.md's that might otherwise get overlooked.

**When creating a new repository on GitHub, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files.**
